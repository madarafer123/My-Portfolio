    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I‚Äôm David! At 24 years old, my professional journey has been a diverse and exciting adventure, filled with valuable lessons and growth opportunities.</p>

    <p>It all began in the bustling aisles of <strong>Continente</strong>, where I immersed myself in the fast-paced world of retail. Here, I learned the importance of exceptional customer service and mastering time management.</p>

    <p>Next, I transitioned to <strong>Pizza Hut</strong>, where I thrived in a dynamic and high-pressure environment. Serving customers and working closely with a team taught me the value of collaboration and the joy of creating positive customer experiences.</p>

    <p>From there, I ventured into the energy sector at <strong>Galp</strong>, managing the unique challenges of a petrol station. This role sharpened my ability to stay calm under pressure, solve problems efficiently, and adapt to an ever-changing flow of customers.</p>

    <p>My journey then took me to the heart of a factory, where I embraced the importance of teamwork and operational efficiency. Collaborating with colleagues to achieve shared goals honed my communication and organizational skills.</p>

    <p>In September 2021, I began a new chapter by enrolling in a <strong>Computer Technician</strong> course. It was here that I discovered my passion for programming, igniting a drive to deepen my knowledge and skills in this exciting field.</p>

    <p>Most recently, I joined the vibrant team at <strong>BriZ√© Restaurant</strong>, where I mastered the art of hospitality. Serving customers with care and ensuring every detail was perfect reinforced my commitment to excellence in service.</p>

    <p>Each step of my career has shaped me into a resilient, adaptable, and dedicated professional. I‚Äôm passionate about providing exceptional experiences and continually learning and growing.</p>

    <p>I‚Äôm excited about the future and eager to embrace new opportunities that challenge me to innovate and excel. This is just the beginning of my story, and I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next.</p>
